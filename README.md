# Assets-ZIP-management-with-PhysFS

I am Unai a videogame student at the UPC, this is my research project on the physFs library.
 
In the release section you can download a .rar in which you will find a crape called handout and a folder called solution in the handout, 
You will find 6 TODOS that should be done to understand how the library works.

In the solution folder are all the TODOS facts to show the correct solution. 

This project also includes a power point presentation to introduce the topic on a website where it is also explained 
the topic along with other concepts that are interesting.

Official page of the library here:
