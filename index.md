# Main objectives

The general objective of using this library is to have the assest in a zip to get the advantages mentioned in the previous point.

Our goal will be to move from the first image to the second.

- First image (what we have):

- Second image (our objetive):

# What is PhysFs?

PhysFs is a library that allows us to access files in an abstract way. This will be very useful for video games.

The programmer must indicate to the PhysFs library the directory with which he wants to work, in this way no writing or reading that comes from the library will be able to leave the indicated directory, with this we gain security, also thanks to the flexibility of the library we will be able to work with all types of files, including Zip files that will be very useful to reduce the memory of the files without losing anything

In summary, using this library we obtain these advantages:

- Security, the library will not allow reading or writing outside of the given directory.
- Flexibility, we can use Zip files as a directory. 
- Saving space, by using a zip file to save assets we achieve that our game takes up less memory space.

This library is supported by the following archives:

- ZIP (pkZip/WinZip/Info-ZIP compatible)                                                                 
- 7Z (7zip archives)
- ISO (ISO9660 files, CD-ROM images)
- GRP (Build Engine groupfile archives)
- PAK (Quake I/II archive format)
- HOG (Descent I/II HOG file archives)
- MVL (Descent II movielib archives)
- WAD (DOOM engine archives)
- VDF (Gothic I/II engine archives)
- SLB (Independence War archives)

# PhysFs

## functions

- PHYSFS_init(): 

This function initializes the library, and should be called at the beginning.

* input: Don't need any element per parameter.
* output: Nonzero on success, zero on error, the error can be specified with the function PHYSFS_getLastError().

- PHYSFS_deinit(): 

Deinitialize the PhysicsFS library, closes any files opened via PhysicsFS, blanks the search/write paths, frees memory.

* input: Don't need any element per parameter.
* output: Nonzero on success, zero on error, the error can be specified with the function PHYSFS_getLastError().

- PHYSFS_addToSearchPath(const char* newDir, int appendToPath): 

Add an archive or directory to the search path.

* input: newDir:.
* output:.



PHYSFS_mount(const char* newDir, const char* mountPoint, int appendToPath ):

PHYSFS_openRead(const char* filename): 
PHYSFS_fileLength(PHYSFS_file* handle):
PHYSFS_Read(PHYSFS_File* handle, void* buffer, PHYSFS_uint32 objSize, PHYSFS_uint32 objCount): reads data from a PhysFS filehandle. Handle is the handle returned from PHYSFS_openRead(), buffer is where data info is stored, objSize is size in bytes of objects readed from handle and objCount number of objects to read from handle.
PHYSFS_close(PHYSFS_file* handle):
PHYSFS_getLastErrorCode():
